# Potato Plant Disease Detection using CNN

## Project Overview
This project is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification model** for detecting diseases in potato plant leaves.  
The model can classify an uploaded leaf image into one of the following categories:  

- **Potato___Healthy**  
- **Potato___Early_Blight**  
- **Potato___Late_Blight**

The system helps in **early disease detection** and supports farmers and agricultural researchers in improving crop yield and reducing losses.

## Model Architecture (Conv2D Neural Network)
The model is built using **TensorFlow/Keras** with multiple **Conv2D** and **MaxPooling layers** to extract features from potato leaf images.

**Model Summary:**
- **Input Layer** ‚Üí Resized leaf images (256x256)  
- **Convolutional Layers (Conv2D)** ‚Üí Detect low-level (edges, textures) and high-level (disease spots) features  
- **Pooling Layers (MaxPooling2D)** ‚Üí Reduce dimensionality while preserving important features  
- **Dropout Layers** ‚Üí Prevent overfitting  
- **Fully Connected (Dense) Layers** ‚Üí Classify extracted features into categories  
- **Output Layer** ‚Üí Softmax activation for 3 classes  

**Sample Architecture Code:**
```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout

model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Input(shape=input_shape),
    resize_and_rescale,
    data_augmentation,
    layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3,3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    layers.Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(3,3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    layers.Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(3,3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    layers.Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(3,3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    layers.Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(3,3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(n_classes, activation='softmax')
])
